# Lesson 2: Finalizing Your Memecoin Website, Branding, and Setting Up Social Branding with AI

## Objectives
- Use Grok 4 for researching current branding trends in memecoins, refining prompts for style guides, and brainstorming community-building strategies with recursive prompting.
- Refine or regenerate your logo, X banner, and DEX banner using Grok 4 or ChatGPT, incorporating feedback from Day 1.
- Create a comprehensive style guide (colors, fonts, typography, usage rules, and meme guidelines) for consistent branding across website, X, and Telegram, emphasizing memeable images for virality.
- Update your memecoin website (`index.html`) in Cursor to apply the style guide, adding refinements like better responsiveness, animations, or additional sections inspired by top Solana memecoin sites.
- Set up branded X profile and Telegram channel/group using your AI-generated assets (logo as profile pic, banners, bio based on narrative).
- Generate initial social content (e.g., tweets, Telegram announcements) using Grok 4 for virality, including memes, and save drafts in Buffer.
- Learn about branding consistency, meme culture, and how AI aids in social setup/community growth.
- (Publishing Step) Update and redeploy the site to GitHub Pages with new branding.

## Prerequisites
- **Completed Day 1:** Have your `memecoin-site-day1` folder with `index.html`, `assets` (logo, banners), and deployed GitHub Pages URL.
- **Tools:** Cursor (for code updates), Grok 4 (research/prompts/content), ChatGPT (image refinement), Photoshop/GIMP (edits), Git (for pushes via Cursor), Buffer (for scheduling X posts).

## Tasks & Instructions
Build on Day 1 by refining branding, creating a style guide with meme guidelines, updating the site, and applying branding to X/Telegram. Use Grok 4 heavily for research and content generation.

### Task 1: Research Branding Trends for Memecoins Using Grok 4
**Goal:** Use Grok 4 to research 2025 memecoin branding trends, focusing on colors, fonts, virality, and meme culture. Compare meta vs. animal themes from Day 1.

1. **Access Grok 4:**
   - Via grok.com or X app (Premium+ or SuperGrok required).
2. **Research Prompt:**
   - Prompt Grok 4: "Research successful memecoin branding trends in 2025 (as of August 03, 2025, 08:32 AM CDT). Provide 5 examples of top Solana memecoins (e.g., BONK, dogwifhat, Popcat) with their websites, color palettes, fonts, key aesthetic features, and meme strategies (e.g., how mascots are used in viral memes). Explain why these drive virality and compare branding for 'meta' concepts vs. animal-themed ones."
   - Example output: "1. BONK (bonkcoin.com) - Vibrant orange/yellow palette, playful sans-serif fonts, mascot-heavy layout. Memes: Bonk dog with laser eyes in 'to the moon' posts. Viral due to fun vibe. 2. dogwifhat (dogwifcoin.org) - Pink/blue colors, bold graffiti fonts. Memes: Dog in hat with ironic captions. Animal-themed: Cute mascot for shareability. Meta: Satirical trends."
3. **Recursive Refinement:**
   - Prompt: "Refine the above research into a prompt for generating a style guide Markdown file in Cursor, tailored to my [animal/meta] memecoin concept: [your narrative]. Include colors, fonts, typography, logo usage rules, and meme guidelines for using the mascot in viral images."
4. **Apply Insights:**
   - Note trends (e.g., vibrant colors, memeable mascots) to inform your refinements and meme strategies.
5. **Prompt for Help:**
   - Ask Cursor Chat: "Summarize Grok 4's memecoin branding research, including meme strategies, and suggest how it applies to my [your concept]."

### Task 2: Refine the Logo
**Goal:** Iterate on your Day 1 logo using feedback and trends, ensuring it’s memeable.

1. **Refine the Logo:**
   - Prompt Grok 4: "Generate a refined prompt for updating my logo based on 2025 trends: [describe issues, e.g., make colors more vibrant like BONK, ensure memeable features like expressive mascot]."
   - Use the output in Grok 4/ChatGPT to regenerate: e.g., "Update the logo for '[your token name]' to feature brighter colors and a memeable mascot pose, inspired by dogwifhat's palette, 500x500 PNG."
   - Edit in Photoshop/GIMP: Adjust based on trends (e.g., add gradients, ensure mascot is expressive for memes).
   - Save updated file in `assets` (e.g., `logo-v2.png`).
2. **Prompt for Help:**
   - Ask Cursor Chat: "How to refine my AI-generated logo based on trends, ensuring it’s memeable?"

### Task 3: Study and Refine the X Banner
**Goal:** Study effective X banners from top memecoins and refine your own.

1. **Study Step:** Research top Solana memecoin X banners to understand what makes them effective. Visit the X profiles of top memecoins (e.g., @bonk_inu for BONK, @dogwifhat for dogwifhat, @POPCATSOL for Popcat, @mew for MEW, @Darkfarms1 for BOME). Observe elements like mascot placement, taglines, color schemes, and how they tie into the narrative for virality (e.g., BONK’s banner often features an energetic dog in orange tones with fun text overlays; dogwifhat’s is minimalist with the dog in a hat on a pink background).
2. **AI Assistance:** Prompt Grok 4: "Describe the X profile banners of top Solana memecoins like BONK (@bonk_inu), dogwifhat (@dogwifhat), Popcat (@POPCATSOL), MEW (@mew), and BOME, including colors, elements, style, and why they work for viral marketing in 2025."
3. **Refine Step:** Use insights to refine your prompt. Prompt Grok 4: "Generate a refined prompt for updating my X banner based on 2025 trends and examples from top memecoins: [describe issues, e.g., add more dynamic elements like Popcat’s popping cat motif]."
   - Use the output in Grok 4/ChatGPT to regenerate: e.g., "Update the X banner for '[your token name]' with vibrant colors and mascot focus, inspired by BONK’s energetic design, 1500x500 PNG."
   - Edit in Photoshop/GIMP: Ensure it fits X’s dimensions (1500x500 pixels) and matches your narrative.
   - Save updated file in `assets` (e.g., `x-banner-v2.png`).
4. **Prompt for Help:**
   - Ask Cursor Chat: "How to refine my X banner based on top memecoin examples?"

### Task 4: Study and Refine the DEX Banner
**Goal:** Study DEX banners from top memecoins on DexScreener and DexTools to fully understand the platforms, their importance, and best practices. Design a single banner that works for both, emphasizing why DexScreener is essential and cheaper for most memecoins.

1. **Study Step:** Research top Solana memecoin DEX banners on both DexScreener and DexTools to fully understand the platforms and design best practices. Visit DexScreener (dexscreener.com/solana/[token-address]) and DexTools (dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/[pair-address]) for top tokens (e.g., BONK, dogwifhat, Popcat, MEW, BOME—find addresses via CoinGecko or the memecoin websites). Observe how banners appear (e.g., often a horizontal image with mascot, tagline, and vibrant colors; DexScreener banners are pulled from on-chain metadata and display prominently on token pages, while DexTools supports GIF animated banners for more dynamic visibility).
   - Key Differences: DexScreener is favored by most memecoins (especially those launched on LetsBonk.fun or pump.fun) because updating token info (including banners) is free via on-chain metadata updates, making it cost-effective and accessible. DexTools, while powerful, often requires burning DEXT tokens (their native token) for updates or premium features, which can cost money—leading to higher barriers for small projects.
   - Emphasis: Having a presence on DexScreener is absolutely required for visibility, as it’s the go-to for Solana traders due to its speed, mobile-friendliness, and organic trend tracking. DexTools is useful for advanced analytics but less essential initially.
2. **AI Assistance:** Prompt Grok 4: "Describe the DEX banners on DexScreener and DexTools for top Solana memecoins like BONK, dogwifhat, Popcat, MEW, and BOME, including colors, elements, style, and differences between the platforms. Explain why most memecoins prefer DexScreener (cheaper updates) over DexTools in 2025."
3. **Setup Preview (For Future Days):** Although you won’t set up the banners today, understand the process:
   - **DexScreener (Required, Free):** Update your token’s on-chain metadata using Solana tools like Metaplex Token Metadata (e.g., via CLI command `spl-token update-metadata` or a tool like token-creator apps). Upload the banner image to a decentralized storage like Arweave or IPFS, then link it in the metadata JSON under 'image' or 'banner' fields. DexScreener automatically pulls and displays it—no fees.
   - **DexTools (Optional, May Cost):** Go to info.dextools.io, submit an update request form with your token address, upload banner (supports GIFs), and pay by burning DEXT tokens if required for verification or priority.
4. **Refine Step:** Design a single banner that works for both (1500x500 PNG or GIF, mascot-focused). Prompt Grok 4: "Generate a refined prompt for updating my DEX banner (single for DexScreener and DexTools) based on 2025 trends and examples from top memecoins: [describe issues, e.g., make it animated like DexTools examples if possible]."
   - Use the output in Grok 4/ChatGPT to regenerate: e.g., "Update the DEX banner for '[your token name]' with bold tagline and theme elements, inspired by MEW’s cat design, 1500x500 PNG."
   - Edit in Photoshop/GIMP: Optimize for both platforms (e.g., high-res, transparent if needed).
   - Save updated file in `assets` (e.g., `dex-banner-v2.png`).
5. **Prompt for Help:**
   - Ask Cursor Chat: "Explain the importance of DexScreener vs. DexTools and how to refine my DEX banner."

### Task 5: Generate Style Guide
**Goal:** Create a style guide document incorporating insights from the logo and banner studies, with a specific focus on memes and memeable images, including sample guidelines for using the mascot to create viral memes.

1. **Create Style Guide with Meme Guidelines:**
   - Prompt Cursor Composer: Generate prompt that will create a Markdown file (style-guide.md) for my memecoin branding. 

2. **Store Locally:**
   - Add `style-guide.md` to your project folder.
3. **Prompt for Help:**
   - Ask Cursor Chat: "How to create a style guide incorporating my refined assets and meme guidelines?"

### Task 6: Update the Website with Style Guide
**Goal:** Apply the style guide to `index.html` for consistency, adding refinements inspired by trends.

1. **Refine Prompt with Grok 4:**
   - Prompt Grok 4: "Create a refined prompt for updating my memecoin index.html to incorporate a style guide: [paste key style guide elements, including meme guidelines]. Add animations, better mobile responsiveness, and inspiration from 2025 top sites like bonkcoin.com."
2. **Update in Cursor Composer:**
   - Paste the refined prompt: e.g., "Update index.html to use style guide colors (#FF4500 primary), fonts (import 'Poppins' from Google Fonts), typography rules, and integrate meme gallery with placeholder meme images based on style guide. Enhance with fade-in animations in CSS, ensure full responsiveness, update image paths if needed."
   - Cursor edits `index.html`—verify changes in `<style>` and meme gallery.
3. **Add Features:**
   - Prompt: "Add a new section to index.html for 'Style Guide Preview' embedding key elements from style-guide.md, including a meme showcase."
4. **Test Locally:**
   - Open in browser, check consistency (e.g., colors match banners, memes display), responsiveness.
5. **Prompt for Help:**
   - Ask Cursor Chat: "Fix any CSS issues in index.html after applying style guide, like font loading or meme gallery display."

### Task 7: Set Up Branding for X (Twitter)
**Goal:** Apply branding to your X profile for professional, viral appeal. Study how top memecoins set up their profiles, including placing the contract address (CA) prominently (e.g., in bio or pinned post), website links, cashtags ($TICKER), and fun narratives in bios to drive engagement.

1. **Study Top Memecoin X Profiles:**
   - Research setups of top Solana memecoins to understand best practices. Visit profiles like @bonk_inu (BONK), @dogwifcoin (dogwifhat), @POPCATSOL (Popcat), @mew (MEW), @Darkfarms1 (BOME creator).
   - Observe: Bios often include $TICKER, "on Solana", fun phrases, website/TG links; CA in bio (e.g., BONK has "Token ID: [CA]") or pinned launch post; Pinned posts typically the "Go Live" announcement with CA for easy sharing.
   - **AI Assistance:** Prompt Grok 4: "Describe the X profile setup (bio text, links, cashtag usage, pinned post, CA placement) for top Solana memecoins like BONK (@bonk_inu), dogwifhat (@dogwifcoin), Popcat (@POPCATSOL), MEW (@mew), and Book of Meme (@Darkfarms1). Explain why these elements (e.g., CA in bio, $TICKER) are effective for virality in 2025."
   - **Discover More Memecoins:** To expand research, prompt Grok 4: "Suggest 5 additional top Solana memecoins in August 2025 (e.g., from CoinGecko lists like Moo Deng, Gigachad) with their X handles, and briefly describe their profile setups." Use insights to refine your own.
2. **Create/Access X Account:**
   - Go to x.com, create @YourTokenName if needed.
3. **Apply Assets:**
   - Profile Pic: Upload logo-v2.png (crop to circle in Photoshop if needed).
   - Banner: Upload x-banner-v2.png (1500x500).
   - Bio: Prompt Grok 4: "Write a catchy X bio for [your token name] based on narrative: [your narrative]. Include $TICKER, placeholder CA, website URL, hashtags, and links to TG/DexScreener, inspired by top setups like BONK."
     - Example: "KylieShib $KYL - The fluffiest memecoin on Solana! CA: [placeholder] Join the pack 🚀 Website: [your GitHub Pages URL] #ShibaArmy t.me/[channel]"
4. **Pin a Tweet:**
   - Prompt Grok 4: "Generate a viral placeholder launch tweet for my memecoin, including CA, website link, and DEX banner image, to pin like top memecoins."
   - Post and pin it (use placeholders for CA/Dex links).
5. **Verify:**
   - Ensure branding matches style guide (e.g., colors in bio emojis, meme-friendly tone) and mimics top profiles for virality.
6. **Prompt for Help:**
   - Ask Cursor Chat: "Guide me to set up an X profile for my memecoin with AI-generated bio and assets, including CA and cashtag."

### Task 8: Set Up Branding for Telegram
**Goal:** Create a branded Telegram channel/group for community engagement, ensuring a public entry gate using the legitimate Safeguard bot to prevent spam and bots, which is especially useful for memecoin communities.

1. **Create Channel/Group with Safeguard in Mind:**
   - In the Telegram app, create a private group for members to discuss (this will be the main community space).
   - Create a public channel (e.g., t.me/YourTokenChannel) where the Safeguard portal will be posted as the public entry point.
   - **Note:** Using a private group with a public portal helps protect against spam and unauthorized access, common in memecoin projects.
2. **Add and Set Up Safeguard Bot (Official Username: @safeguard):**
   - Search for and add the official @safeguard bot to both your private group and public channel.
   - Make @safeguard an admin in both the group and channel (go to Manage Group/Channel > Administrators > Add Admin > Search for @safeguard).
   - In a private chat with @safeguard, type `/setup`.
   - Click 'Select a group' and choose your private group.
   - Click 'Select a channel' and choose your public channel.
   - Follow any additional prompts to create the portal. This sets up a verification portal in the public channel, acting as a secure entry gate where users verify (e.g., via tap to join) before being added to the private group.
   - **Warning:** Only use the official @safeguard bot. Beware of fake bots mimicking "Safeguard" that may be scams asking for SMS codes or personal info—legitimate setup does not require this.
   - **Customization:** After setup, you can add media, text, or buttons to the portal (e.g., link to your website or DEX) by messaging @safeguard.
3. **Apply Assets and Branding:**
   - Profile Pic: Upload logo-v2.png to both the group and channel.
   - Description: Prompt Grok 4: "Write a Telegram channel description for [your token name]: [your narrative]. Include rules, links to website/X/DexScreener, and mention the Safeguard portal for secure joining."
   - Use DEX banner as a pinned message image or in the description.
4. **Initial Post:**
   - Prompt Grok 4: "Generate a welcome announcement post for my Telegram channel, with memes (use style guide meme guidelines) and calls to action, highlighting the Safeguard entry gate for security."
   - Post it in the channel and pin if needed.
5. **Apply Style:**
   - Use emojis/colors from style guide in text and descriptions.
6. **Verify Setup:**
   - Test the portal by trying to join via the public channel—ensure it verifies and adds to the private group.
7. **Prompt for Help:**
   - Ask Cursor Chat: "How to set up a branded Telegram channel for my memecoin using AI, including Safeguard bot for a secure public entry gate?"

### Task 9: Generate Initial Social Content
**Goal:** Create content to kickstart community on X and Telegram. To do this effectively, study recent memecoin launches on LetsBonk.fun to understand standard X posts: the "Go Live" post with contract address (usually pinned), follow-up when the token bonds (e.g., liquidity added or reaches Raydium), and posts confirming submissions to CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko (CG). Focus on how images, short posts, narrative, and humor are used for virality.

1. **Study Recent Launches on LetsBonk Using Grok 4:**
   - Prompt Grok 4: "Find 5-10 recent memecoin launches on LetsBonk.fun from today (August 03, 2025) and the last few days (since July 30, 2025). Provide their token names, X handles (if available), contract addresses, and links to their launch-related X posts. Describe the sequence of posts: Go Live announcement with CA (often pinned), bonding confirmation, CMC/CG submission posts. Note use of images (e.g., memes, banners), short phrasing, narrative building, and humor."
   - Example insights: Launches often start with a hype "We're live! CA: [address] #LetsBonk" post pinned, followed by "Bonded! Now trading on Raydium" with chart image, then "Submitted to CMC and CG—watch for listing!" with humorous meme about mooning.
   - Visit the X profiles/posts provided to study feeds: Observe chronological posts from launch, how they use emojis, tags, images for engagement, and weave narrative/humor (e.g., satirical takes on trends or mascot-based jokes).
2. **Recursive Prompting for Content Based on Studies:**
   - Prompt Grok 4: "Based on recent LetsBonk launches like [list 2-3 from study, e.g., Sadjak, Honda], generate a refined prompt for creating 5 viral tweets/Telegram posts for my memecoin launch. Include a Go Live post with placeholder CA (pinned), bonding follow-up, CMC/CG submission. Focus on short posts, images (describe placeholders, use style guide meme guidelines), narrative from [your narrative], and humor for virality."
3. **Generate in Grok 4:**
   - Use the refined prompt to get content, e.g., "Tweet 1 (Go Live, pin): '[Your token name] is LIVE on LetsBonk! CA: [placeholder] Join the [narrative theme] revolution! 🚀 #SolanaMemes' with logo image."
   - Adapt for Telegram announcements, emphasizing community calls-to-action and memes from style guide.
4. **Generate AI Images for CMC and CG Posts:**
   - For the CMC and CG submission tweets, enhance with visuals. Prompt Grok 4 or ChatGPT: "Generate an AI image of the CoinMarketCap logo stylized to fit my memecoin theme [describe narrative, e.g., with a Shiba dog mascot], high-res PNG." Repeat for CoinGecko.
   - Download and save as `assets/cmc-image.png` and `assets/cg-image.png`. Edit in Photoshop/GIMP if needed (e.g., add text like "Submitted!").
5. **Set Up Buffer and Save Drafts:**
   - **Set Up Buffer:** Buffer is a free tool for scheduling X posts.
     - Sign up for a free Buffer account at https://buffer.com/signup.
     - Connect your X account: Go to Channels in Buffer[](https://account.buffer.com/channels), follow the prompts to link your X profile (log in to X in another tab as the owner).
     - Refresh the channel if prompted (see https://support.buffer.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-buffer).
   - **Save Drafts in Buffer:** Use Buffer’s composer to draft the first 5 launch tweets (e.g., Go Live, Bonding, CMC submission with cmc-image.png, CG submission with cg-image.png, and a follow-up hype post using a style guide meme). Add images where applicable, save as drafts (not scheduled yet). Note: Free plan allows scheduling to one channel; up to 100 posts/day limit; supports images up to 5MB.
   - Post one manually on X/Telegram if desired; keep the rest as drafts in Buffer for Day 3 launch.
6. **Prompt for Help:**
   - Ask Cursor Chat: "Suggest ways to use AI for generating more social content based on LetsBonk launch studies."

### Task 10: Understand Branding & Community with AI
