## Technical Appendix: LMS Parsing Guidelines

### **Lesson Structure for LMS Integration**

#### **Required Sections (in order):**
1. **Title**: `# Lesson X: [Lesson Title]`
2. **Objectives**: `## Objectives` (7 bullet points)
3. **Prerequisites**: `## Prerequisites` (Tools, Accounts, Knowledge, Note)
4. **Setup**: `## Setup: [Setup Section Title]` (5 setup steps)
5. **Tasks & Instructions**: `## Tasks & Instructions`
6. **AI Prompts**: `## AI Prompts for [Lesson Title]`
7. **Learning Outcomes**: `## Learning Outcomes`
8. **Next Steps**: `## Next Steps`

#### **Task Structure:**
Each lesson contains **7-11 tasks** with the following pattern:
- `### Task X: [Task Title]`
- `**Goal:** [Clear goal statement]`
- `1. **[Subtask X.1]:**` (3-5 subtasks per task)
- `2. **[Subtask X.2]:**`
- `3. **[Subtask X.3]:**`
- `4. **[Subtask X.4]:**` (optional)
- `5. **[Subtask X.5]:**` (optional)

### **Parsing Rules for LMS Developers**

#### **Section Boundaries:**
- **Objectives**: From `## Objectives` to `## Prerequisites`
- **Prerequisites**: From `## Prerequisites` to `## Setup`
- **Setup**: From `## Setup:` to `## Tasks & Instructions`
- **Tasks**: From `## Tasks & Instructions` to `## AI Prompts`
- **AI Prompts**: From `## AI Prompts` to `## Learning Outcomes`
- **Learning Outcomes**: From `## Learning Outcomes` to `## Next Steps`
- **Next Steps**: From `## Next Steps` to end of file

#### **Task Parsing:**
- **Task Start**: `### Task X: [Task Title]`
- **Task Goal**: `**Goal:** [statement]`
- **Subtask Pattern**: `X. **[Subtask X.Y]:**`
- **Task End**: Next `### Task` or section boundary

#### **Content Types:**
- **Instructions**: Bullet points under subtasks
- **Code blocks**: Preserved as-is
- **Links**: Preserved as-is
- **Images**: Referenced by URL or path

### **LMS Integration Points**

#### **Progress Tracking:**
- **Task completion**: Each task can be marked complete
- **Subtask granularity**: Track progress at subtask level
- **Learning outcomes**: Measurable outcomes for assessment

#### **Content Extraction:**
- **Objectives**: For course overview and prerequisites
- **Tasks**: For step-by-step instruction display
- **AI Prompts**: For AI assistance integration
- **Learning Outcomes**: For assessment and validation

#### **Navigation:**
- **Task-based navigation**: Jump to specific tasks
- **Section-based navigation**: Jump to objectives, setup, etc.
- **Progress indicators**: Show completion status per task

### **Validation Rules**

#### **Required Elements:**
- [ ] Title starts with "Lesson X:"
- [ ] Has Objectives section with 7 bullet points
- [ ] Has Prerequisites section with 4 subsections
- [ ] Has Setup section with 5 steps
- [ ] Has Tasks & Instructions section
- [ ] Has AI Prompts section
- [ ] Has Learning Outcomes section
- [ ] Has Next Steps section

#### **Task Validation:**
- [ ] Each task has a title and goal
- [ ] Each task has 3-5 subtasks
- [ ] Each subtask has detailed instructions
- [ ] Task numbering is sequential (1, 2, 3, etc.)

### **Example Parsing Logic**

```javascript
// Example LMS parsing logic
const parseLesson = (markdown) => {
  const sections = {
    title: extractTitle(markdown),
    objectives: extractSection(markdown, '## Objectives', '## Prerequisites'),
    prerequisites: extractSection(markdown, '## Prerequisites', '## Setup'),
    setup: extractSection(markdown, '## Setup:', '## Tasks & Instructions'),
    tasks: extractTasks(markdown),
    aiPrompts: extractSection(markdown, '## AI Prompts', '## Learning Outcomes'),
    learningOutcomes: extractSection(markdown, '## Learning Outcomes', '## Next Steps'),
    nextSteps: extractSection(markdown, '## Next Steps', 'EOF')
  };
  
  return sections;
};
```

### **Notes for LMS Developers**

1. **Content is preserved exactly** - no modifications needed
2. **Structure is predictable** - same sections in same order
3. **Tasks are variable** - 7-11 tasks per lesson
4. **Subtasks are consistent** - 3-5 subtasks per task
5. **AI integration ready** - AI prompts section included
6. **Assessment ready** - Learning outcomes section included

This structure allows for rich, interactive learning experiences while maintaining content integrity and LMS compatibility.

## Task Structure Guidelines

### Task Components
Each task should include:
- **Title:** Clear, descriptive task name
- **Goal:** Specific, measurable objective for the task
- **Subtasks:** 3-5 detailed subtasks with specific instructions
- **Instructions:** Step-by-step guidance for completion

### Subtask Structure
Each subtask should include:
- **Numbered format:** 1. **[Subtask X.Y]:**
- **Detailed instructions:** Multiple bullet points with specific guidance
- **Clear outcomes:** What should be accomplished

### Content Guidelines
- **Technical accuracy:** Preserve code, commands, and technical specifications
- **Educational clarity:** Make instructions clear and actionable
- **Progressive complexity:** Build skills from basic to advanced
- **Practical application:** Focus on real-world implementation

### Structure Standards
- **7-11 tasks** per lesson (not 2 as in old templates)
- **3-5 subtasks** per task
- **Goal statement** for each task
- **Detailed instructions** under each subtask
- **AI integration** with prompts section
- **Learning outcomes** for assessment
- **Next steps** for progression
